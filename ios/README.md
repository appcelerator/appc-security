# Appcelerator Security Library for IOS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/appcelerator/appc-security.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/appcelerator/appc-security)

This is a basic security library for decryption and other security related tasks that are common in iOS.

This library was created as a secure coding best practice for use with Appcelerator iOS related software.

It is made available on GitHub for peer review and for transparency in our security practices.  If you find a security related issue with this software, please use [Responsible Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities](http://www.appcelerator.com/privacy/responsible-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities/) by reporting it.

## Usage

The following APIs are available:

- `AppC_hmac256(key,data)`: HMAC-256 using key data
- `AppC_sha1(data)`: SHA1 data
- `AppC_decrypt(value,key,pepper,hmacKey,encoding,size)`: decrypt a previously encrypted blob
- `AppC_decryptWithKey(value,derivedKey,pepper,hmacKey,encoding,size)`: decrypt a previously encrypted blob using a precalculated derived key

### Example Decryption

After an encryption (not shown), use the information provided (however, not stored in the source code, please!):

```objective-c
NSString *value = @"n8aMjHGhlGd18E37vVOY3AYdRT7clytlLaUfuuNQBpA/lETIkpQ2ikkSRcpp111LbLZ6c3A4FCcAimr5iGa3Z4035gAJohB8zugVxDoxE9JQMTwFQP0aDDUzn15H18ytDGwxzgtxMdaTNdJrykw9CrRrdPVrguksPvS+rB32DOXUtf0b+CiwR7048fzxbtXTucHDP1+zmheIy0WXtYCFdfwLpTN2fDxn+GIYwRzljCslG8+9YOeiYgaPo854f9hUCSSGPtg08OLTQsipZw3O6ixUwmdQyyxm/w8rpr5y2I1Te9ocxcOZpXpZ7j2UaZvgvI6DcvG2wLsuYPYB9XSiWO+LCCRTMIR2SQOTACaXQS++wJGUPIpmfFHaA5uJvmbUzeqSBw3Kf8gyDLuffor32Y0PrA7sl/Lb0GkJlStwfrw=";
NSString *key = @"key";
NSString *pepper = @"pepper";
NSString *hmacKey = @"hmacKey";
NSString *encoding = @"base64";
NSString *result = AppC_decrypt(value,key,pepper,hmacKey,encoding,128);
```

The above example will decrypt the encrypted blob and return the result `ABC` if decryption was successful or `nil` if not.

### Building the Library

Please run the included `build.sh` to build a universal static library with the following architectures: `armv7`, `arm64`, `i386`, `x86_64`.

Take the resulting library in `build/libappcsecurity.a` and use it in your Xcode project.
